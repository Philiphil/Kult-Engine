# Fullstack PHP Framework

The Kult engine is a php framework aiming to be a lightweight and easy to use/configure/install/learn set of powerful tools able to fit every website's common task and need.

**PHP 7**

**Version : 1.33.1**

## Why choose the Kult Engine ?

I dont think someone should have linux, composer, wget, git, docker, then run 11 command in order to download a folder with .php files.

You can drag & drop your website on a whole different server, just conf.php will require any change and no download will be required.

Based on this idea to make something that runs quick, the kult engine stated to grow, and since version 33.1 is proud to be ready for production.

## Features
* Easy to use, learn, install and run.

* MVC
* Router

* and so much more.
