# Kult Engine

Kult Engine is a FullStack php framework aiming to be a lightweight and easy to use/configure/install/learn set of powerful tools able to fit every website's common task and need

Kult Engine is still under development but wont be updated in this repos til October 2017.  
A few incompatibilities might occur.

PHP : 7  
Version : BETA

##Why would someone choose Kult-Engine over CodeIgniter/Laravel/Symphony 2/Slim/Cake ... ?  
Don't.
I've made Kult-Engine for myself, because I didn't want to use those frameworks.
- I didn't want to have to learn everything about a complex software in order to be able to "hello world", I mean : Come on ; The whole purpose of a framework is to help me to code quickly
- I didn't want a ton of heavy and useless helpers that I won't use unless I'm forced to.
- I didn't want to have to write 'use legit_namespace\somewhat_legit_sub_namespace\useless_sub_sub_namespace\classname\classname;' 8 times in every file, no matter what PSR XXVIII told
- I didn't want something too far from vanilla PHP, I mean, if you hate PHP this much, don't use it
- I didn't want to be required to use linux, install 3 softwares and  run 13 commands in order to get a folder full of .php files, what is wrong with you people ?


Since this list goes on and on;  
Since this list applies almost everywhere;  
Since no one seems to complain about it;  
You probably should not use the Kult Engine.
