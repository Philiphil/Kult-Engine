The Kult Engine is a PHP framework aiming to be a lightweight and easy to use/configure/install/learn set of powerful tools able to fit every website's common needs

**PHP 8**

**Version : 2:PRE-RELEASE2**



## Why choose the Kult Engine ?

A website is a folder full of PHP files, it should run anywhere, it should not require composer, docker, any particular OS, wget, nor to run 11 commands in order to run.
You should not have to spend more time editing yaml files than do actual coding.

You can drag & drop your website on a whole different server, just config.php will require any change and no download will be required.

Based on this idea to make something that runs quick, the kult engine started to grow, and since version 0.33.1 is proud to be ready for production.
